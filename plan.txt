1. memorize squares
- random square input if it is black or white

2. imagine a piece on chessboard
- random piece, input all the moves of the piece

3. movement
- random piece (recomended knight), you get start and end, and you input the moves so it gets to the required square

3.5. peice capture
- knigh and queen, knight has to caputre queen without getting captured by the queen

Now you can play blindfold chess

4. Set number of moves blind, then the board is revealed, e.g. 5 moves then the board is shown then 5 moves, you play agiainst ai (you set the difficulty)
- settings like having an empty board for help

5. Play as many moves as you can, when you are stuck you have a button that shows you your position

6. Blindfold chess no help
- each step collects stats so you can monitor your progress
